This is a full-stack recipe management app that allows users to create, update, and view recipes. 
The app features a front-end built using React, where users can browse recipes with pagination, view recipe details, and update them, including uploading images. 
The back-end utilizes a REST API built with Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL to handle data storage, retrieval, and image upload.
PostgreSQL serves as the database for recipe data, and the API allows users to manage recipes efficiently. 
The app automatically updates the UI with new or modified data, ensuring a smooth user experience.

The Front End is created in react, and not show in this repository.
